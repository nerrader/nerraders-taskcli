# Nerrader's TaskCLI
Nerrader's TaskCLI was a tool that was born out of necessity. I always had my own problems organizing and trying to remember my tasks and responsibilities, which has led to me frequently forgetting deadlines and oftentimes doing things at the last minute. Those problems have caused me so much mental stress amd fatigue over the years.

So, I built this tool to get rid of my mental clutter by providing a way to better organize and track my responsibilities, so I can focus my time and energy on actually doing the work, rather than spending time worrying about what I might have forgotten.

# Features

- ### Core Features of a Task Manager
    Adding, deleting, updating, marking, listing tasks are all here.

- ### Customizable Settings
    This tool uses the `questionary` module to open up an interactive menu to customize the settings by typing out a command.

- ### Local Storage
    This tool does not require an internet connection to run. You can still manage and use all the features while being offline without drawbacks.
  
- ### Logging
    This tool uses the `loguru` module for logging and troubleshooting the app.
  
- ### Additional Commands
    This tool has some additional commands like `clear` to clear your entire tasklist, and `reset` to factory reset both your tasklist and configs.

- ### Additional Task Attributes
    This tool has additional task attributes like priority, and duedates.

# How to Download/Install

> [!NOTE]
> Before using this tool, make sure you have: Windows 10 or more, as it doesn't work on other OSes.

1. Download the latest .exe file from the latest [Release](https://github.com/nerrader/nerraders-mc-mod-downloader/releases)
2. Run the .exe file
3. If Windows flags the .exe as unrecognized, click on **More Info > Run Anyway**

    > _This happens because this tool is new and does not have a paid Certificate, as it would require me $200 to sign it._
    
4. You're done!

# How to Use

To use the CLI, open your terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) in the directory where you downloaded the .exe file, and run taskcli --help to see all available commands.

> [!NOTE]
> This tool creates a directory in `AppData/Roaming/taskcli` to store and modfiy essential files for it to function.

Here are the list of the main commands in the CLI, and their general purpose.
Again, to find more about it's arguments and options and aliases, use --help to generate the help menu for that specific command.

#### Main TaskCLI Commands:

| add | task_name | Adds a new task with that task name |
| delete | task_id | Removes a specific task from your list based on its unique ID. |
