# Nerrader's TaskCLI

Nerrader's TaskCLI was a tool that was born out of necessity. I always had my own problems organizing and trying to remember my tasks and responsibilities, which has led to me frequently forgetting deadlines and oftentimes doing things at the last minute. And over time, those problems have caused me significant mental stress amd fatigue over the years.

So, I built this tool to get rid of my mental clutter by providing a way to better organize and track my responsibilities, so I can focus my time and energy on actually doing the work, rather than spending time worrying about what I might have forgotten.

## Features

- ### Core Features of a TaskCLI

    Adding, deleting, updating, marking, listing tasks are all here.

- ### Customizable Settings

    This tool uses the `questionary` module to open up an **interactive menu to customize the settings** by typing out a command.

- ### Local Storage

    This tool does not require an internet connection to run. You can still manage and use all the features while being **offline** without drawbacks.

- ### Logging

    This tool uses the `loguru` module for **logging and troubleshooting** the app.

- ### Additional Task Attributes

    This tool has additional task attributes like priority, duedates, and tags

- ### Tasklists

    This tool allows for the adding, removing, renaming and switching of different tasklists, so you can group your tasks more easily.

- ### Undo / Redo

    This tool allows you to undo and redo changes in the tasklist by using `undo` and `redo` commands respectively.

## How to Download & Use

With these instructions, I am assuming you are using the **latest version of the tool**.

1. **Download the .zip folder**, from the latest [release.](https://github.com/nerrader/nerrader-taskcli-python/releases)
2. **Extract** the .zip folder.
3. **Open your terminal**, and navigate to the **folder containing the .exe.**
4. Start running commands!

> [!important]
> If Windows flags the .exe as unrecognized, click on **More Info > Run Anyway**
>
> This happens because this tool is new and does not have a paid Certificate. That would cost me $200/year to sign.

### Quick Usage

Here are some **quick commands** to get you to know how it works better:

```bash
taskcli add get groceries
```

This command **adds a task** called 'get groceries' with ID 1

```bash
taskcli list
```

This command **lists the table** of tasks that you currently have.

```bash
taskcli update 1 --name "play ultrakill"
```

This command **updates the task** with ID 1 with a new name: "play ultrakill"

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Command options with multiple values (such as names), must be put inside quotation marks.

```bash
taskcli delete 1
```

This command **removes the task with ID 1**, which in this case is the task we just created called 'get groceries'

Use `--help` after any command to find more about the **command's arguments, options and aliases.**

> [!tip]
> You can also change the .exe file name to make it **shorter.**
> So for example, you can change the file from `TaskCLI.exe` to `task.exe` which makes it so that you only have to type in `task list` instead.
>
> Also, make sure to **check and configure your settings** by using the `config` command, as **defaults might be undesirable.**
